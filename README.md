# A_Scaffold

Rails scaffolds are great for prototyping quickly but do not include important
resource types such as nested resources (ie Post and Comments),
subresources (ie Employee and Address),
polymorphic resources (ie Employee and Addressable) that are often necessary.
A_Scaffold is designed to make prototyping internal company CRUD applications faster.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'a_scaffold'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install a_scaffold

## Usage

```
rails generate a_scaffold PARENT_NAME/NAME [field:type field:type] [options]
```
Parent model should exist before running nested scaffold

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
